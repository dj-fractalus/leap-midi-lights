If you Buy a Leap Motion, follow installation instruction, and try to run python Sample.
you can check the lib folder files that I have to make it run
The code that I use is a very simple modification of the Sample, calculating some distances and sending UDP messages


sudo leapd --camera_framerate_limit 200
python2.7 Sample.py
